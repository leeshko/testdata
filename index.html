            Article 1: The Solar System: An Overview The solar system is a
            gravitationally bound system centered on the Sun, a G-type main-sequence
            star. It consists of eight major planets, their moons, dwarf planets,
            asteroids, comets, and countless smaller objects, all orbiting the Sun.
          </p>
          <p>
            1. The Sun The Sun, a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma, makes up about
            99.86% of the solar system's mass. It provides the energy that sustains
            life on Earth and drives the system's dynamics. Its surface temperature is
            approximately 5,500°C, and its core reaches about 15 million°C.
          </p>
          <p>
            2. The Planets Planets are divided into two categories: Terrestrial Planets:
            Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. These are rocky and smaller in size. Gas
            Giants and Ice Giants: Jupiter and Saturn (gas giants) are primarily
            hydrogen and helium, while Uranus and Neptune (ice giants) contain heavier
            elements like water, ammonia, and methane.
          </p>
          <p>
            3. Moons and Satellites Many planets have natural satellites or moons.
            Earth’s Moon is unique for its size relative to its planet. Jupiter and
            Saturn host over 80 moons each, including the large and geologically active
            Io and Europa.
          </p>
          <p>
            4. Small Solar System Bodies Asteroids: Mostly found in the asteroid belt
            between Mars and Jupiter. They are rocky remnants from the solar system’s
            formation. Comets: Icy objects that release gas and dust when they approach
            the Sun, forming glowing comas and tails. Dwarf Planets: Like Pluto and
            Ceres, these are too small to clear their orbits of other debris.
          </p>
          <p>
            5. Beyond the Planets The Kuiper Belt and Oort Cloud lie beyond Neptune.
            These regions are reservoirs of icy bodies and are thought to be the origin
            of many comets.

            Article 2: Key Features of the Solar System The solar system's structure
            and dynamics offer a fascinating glimpse into the universe's workings.
          </p>
          <p>
            1. Formation and Evolution The solar system formed about 4.6 billion years
            ago from a rotating cloud of gas and dust, called the solar nebula. Gravity
            caused the nebula to collapse, forming the Sun at its center. Remaining
            material coalesced into planets, moons, and other bodies.
          </p>
          <p>
            2. Orbital Dynamics All planets orbit the Sun in the same direction
            (counterclockwise viewed from above the Sun’s north pole). Most planetary
            orbits are nearly circular, except for Mercury’s, which is more elliptical.
            The orbital plane is called the ecliptic plane, though some objects, like
            Pluto, deviate from it.
          </p>
          <p>
            3. Unique Features Mercury: Closest to the Sun, with extreme temperature
            variations. Venus: Earth’s "twin" in size but shrouded in thick clouds of
            sulfuric acid. Earth: The only planet known to support life, with liquid
            water covering 70% of its surface. Mars: Known as the "Red Planet" due to
            its iron oxide-rich soil.
          </p>
          <p>
            4. The Role of Gravity The Sun’s immense gravity governs the motion of all
            solar system bodies. Additionally, interactions among planets cause
            perturbations in orbits, leading to phenomena like orbital resonances.
          </p>
          <p>
            5. Future of the Solar System The Sun will eventually exhaust its nuclear
            fuel, becoming a red giant in about 5 billion years. During this phase, it
            will engulf the inner planets, including Earth, before shedding its outer
            layers and leaving a white dwarf behind.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fun Fact The solar system isn’t static; it’s moving through the Milky Way
            galaxy at an average speed of 828,000 km/h, completing one orbit every
            225-250 million years!
